      rand() does not actually generate a random number. What rand() gives you is a pseudo random number. 
      The algorithm used to generate the list of numbers differs between each compiler.
      srand() is used to select where in the list of pseudo random numbers to start reading from. 
      Think seed == start index. By using srand(), you can make the numbers generated by rand() seem random.
      The typical thing to do, is to put srand() in main(). 
      You really should only call srand() once.


    	#include <stdio.h>  // printf()
    	#include <stdlib.h> // srand(), rand()
    	#include <time.h>   // time()
    
    	int main ()
    	{
    	  srand (time(0));
    	  printf("Random Number: %d\n", rand());
    	  return 0;
    	}
    	
    	The above code seeds rand with time(). 
    	time() gets the local time in seconds, which should be more then enough.

    Did you remember ?
        Middle-square method
        147 
        Engel  Algorithms?  
        
    So as you can see srand() function is necessarily to use.
    - srand((unsigned) time(NULL));

    Also ! 
    Again, C function which is randomize(), if you use that function with rand(),
    randomize() function will be prevent to repeat numbers.
